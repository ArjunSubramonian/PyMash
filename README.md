# PyMash
Creates mashups of songs and evaluates which two songs make the best mashup.

# Important Files
To mashup songs:
1) Place all songs in *examples* directory
2) Run `python quality.py`
3) Mashups should now be in *examples* directory
4) Look for mashup with largest number in *quality.txt* -- this should be the best mashup (or at least the best in a scentific, pop-music sense)
